# qGPT

## Overview

**qGPT** is an ambitious project aimed at creating an adaptive, interactive chatbot that seamlessly integrates with multiple platforms and interfaces. Built as a modular Java application, qGPT is designed to engage users in meaningful conversations across various environments such as in-game chats, websites, and more.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to develop a conversational AI that serves as a friendly and adaptable chat companion. qGPT is intended to:

- **Engage Users Across Multiple Platforms**: Whether in in-game chats, direct messages, or other interfaces, qGPT interacts with users in a consistent and context-aware manner.
- **Adapt to Context and Users**: Adjust its conversation style based on the current mood, participants, topics, and the communication styles of users to provide a personalized experience.
- **Enhance Interactivity**: Go beyond simple text responses by integrating capabilities like executing in-game commands to enrich user engagement.
- **Be Extensible and Scalable**: Utilize a modular architecture that allows for easy addition of new features and interfaces, making qGPT highly adaptable to future needs.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: qGPT is structured with a core engine and separate interface modules (adapters), allowing it to connect to different platforms through well-defined interfaces. This design promotes scalability and ease of maintenance.
- **Memory Management System**:
  - **Global Memory**: Stores public conversation data accessible to all users and interfaces.
  - **User Memory**: Maintains private, user-specific data for personalized interactions, ensuring data privacy and confidentiality.
- **Contextual Formatting**: Responses are formatted according to the interface being used, providing a seamless user experience across platforms.
- **Multi-Threading and Concurrency**: Each interface module operates on its own thread, enabling concurrent interactions without performance degradation.
- **Extensibility**: The system is designed to allow new interfaces and functionalities to be added with minimal impact on existing components.

## Use Cases

- **In-Game Assistant**: Interacts with players in-game, responds to chat messages, executes commands, and can adopt roles or personas to enhance gameplay.
- **Website Chatbot**: Serves as an interactive assistant on websites, capable of guiding users, answering questions, and providing support.
- **Personal Chat Buddy**: Available for direct messages, offering personalized conversations that adapt over time to the user's preferences and communication style.

## Project Status

This project is in its early stages and is being developed for fun during free time. It's a personal exploration into the capabilities of conversational AI and modular software design.

## Vision

The project aspires to push the boundaries of conversational AI by creating a bot that is not only functional but also personable and engaging. By focusing on adaptability and user-centric design, qGPT aims to:

- **Provide Meaningful Interactions**: Go beyond scripted responses to offer dynamic and contextually appropriate conversations.
- **Enhance User Experience**: Integrate smoothly into various platforms, adding value whether users are seeking assistance, entertainment, or companionship.
- **Facilitate Easy Integration**: Allow developers to easily add new platforms and features, fostering a community-driven approach to expansion and improvement.
